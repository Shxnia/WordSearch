Important information before starting the project.

Read carefully!

As a developer, Unity asset store wants me to organize the project in its own folder - 
which is fine and allover, a very good idea to keep projects organized.
Up to now, I never had any issues with that.

In this case, Android doesn't seem to find the "StreamingAssets" as a subfolder (Assets/wordSearch/)
"StreamingAssets" must seem to be rooted to "Assets" directly - or the database is not found (resulting in a grey spot in the category's panel).

This bug could not be reproduced on every Android I used. My galaxy s5 and s7 work fine.
My wife's Moto G showed this bug.


So, please, before starting: move the contents of the "word search" folder directly to the "Assets" folder.

Thanks!
